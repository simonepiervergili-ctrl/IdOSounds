# IdOSounds
IdOSounds is my first original soundfont work with ONLY libre sources and original recordings, both mine and from other authors, but still libre sources. IdO stands for "Istituto di Ortofonologia", which is an orthophonology institute, and it's a place in Rome where I used to go during my childhood.
